Hello! I'm a computer science Ph.D. student and [Knight-Hennessy Scholar](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, working on how we can build better foundation models for biomedicine.

## Research focus

I am interested on building powerful and practical AI for scientific applications. First, my interests are in studying and enabling emergent properties in AI systems for scientific applications. This work involves training general foundation models that can perform task and data transfer across domains and under distribution shifts. Second, I want to build AI systems that can practically interact with scientists, increasing transparency and interpretability of complex reasoning systems used by AI systems to present new hypotheses. I strive to tackle the most challenging problems in biomedicine, with applications in drug discovery and personalized medicine.

## Bio
I grew up in Watertown, TN and earned my Bachelor's of Science from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) in May 2022 with majors in computer science and mathematics and a minor in statistics. I worked with several great mentors at UTK, including [Christopher Strickland](https://www.christopherstrickland.info/), [Vasileios Maroulas](https://sites.google.com/utk.edu/mrg), [Kostas Vogiatzis](https://vogiatzis.utk.edu/), and [Scott Emrich](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~semrich/). I am a recipient of the 2021 [Barry Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/) and an alumnus of the [Summer Institute of Biomedical Informatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/summer-institute-biomedical-informatics) at Harvard Medical School.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked for two years as a research associate under the guidance of [Marinka Zitnik](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/). During my time at HMS, I worked on several impactful projects like [GraphXAI](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/projects/GraphXAI/), [TimeX](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/projects/TimeX/), and [ProCyon](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.10.627665v1).

<!-- My research experience spans AI for science applications, from drug discovery to materials science to epidemiology. In addition to UTK and HMS, I have worked with academic collaborators at MIT, UNC Chapel Hill, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and MIT Lincoln Laboratory as well as industrial collaborators at Eastman Chemical Company. -->

<!-- I am interested broadly in using foundation models and modern AI to advance scientific discovery for biomedicine. My technical interests include 1) endowing AI systems with greater abilities to communicate information to users through interpretability and knowledge-grounded predictions, 2) boosting transfer learning in few/zero-shot regimes across modalities where few data may exist, and 3) understanding why, when, and how foundation models fail or successfully transfer to downstream tasks. I currently work on 1) developing inherently interpretable models that are interpretable to users without sacrificing performance, 2) leveraging multi-modal learning to facilitate zero-shot tasks for discovering new drug targets, and 3) advancing the cross-modality transfer of foundation models. -->
