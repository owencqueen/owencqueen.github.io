Hello! I am a research associate at Harvard Medical School in Biomedical Informatics, working with the [Zitnik Lab](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/).

I plan to pursue a **Ph.D. starting in Fall 2024**, and I am actively searching for programs and groups that fit my interests. Please reach out if you would be interested in working with me!

## Bio
I obtained my Bachelor's of Science from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) in May 2022 with majors in computer science and mathematics and a minor in statistics. During my time at UTK, I was fortunate to work with several great teams, including the [Strickland Lab](https://www.christopherstrickland.info/), the [Maroulas Lab](https://sites.google.com/utk.edu/mrg), the [Vogiatzis Lab](https://vogiatzis.utk.edu/), and the [Emrich Lab](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~semrich/). I am a recipient of the 2021 [Barry Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/), and I was selected to present at the 2022 [Posters on the Hill](https://www.cur.org/what/events/students/poh/). Additionally, I am an alumnus of the [Summer Institute of Biomedical Informatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/summer-institute-biomedical-informatics) at Harvard Medical School. 

My research experience spans AI for science applications, from drug discovery to materials science to epidemiology. In addition to UTK and HMS, I have worked with academic collaborators at MIT, UNC Chapel Hill, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and MIT Lincoln Laboratory as well as industrial collaborators at Eastman Chemical Company. 

## Research Interests
I am interested broadly in robust and trustworthy AI for biomedical research. I am particularly intersted in endowing AI systems with greater abilities to communicate information to users through interpretability and knowledge-grounded predictions. My work is focused on developing these abilities within the modern foundation model paradigm, leveraging large pre-trained models to facilitate biomedical discovery. With these desiderata, I develop AI systems 1) that are inherently interpretable, allowing users to trust explanations provided by the model without sacrificing performance and 2) that leverage multi-modal learning to facilitate zero-shot tasks for discovering new drug targets.
