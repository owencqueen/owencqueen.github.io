short_text: We develop a novel GNN-based architecture for learning properties of polymers. We demonstrate our model on glass transition temperature and the more challenging intrinsic viscosity prediction task, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a novel dataset. We use our model to high-throughput search novel chemical compound space for materials that exhibit desirable properties for materials engineering.
