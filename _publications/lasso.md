short_text: We explore feature selection algorithms for high-dimensional genomic datasets with a particular focus on LASSO-based feature selection. On several tasks, we show that LASSO consistently selects high quality features for machine learning, robust to tasks and hyperparameter selection. We focus our analysis on sepsis prediction from microbial sequencing data and environmental conditions from bulk rhizosphere sequencing data (microbiome in the soil around tree roots).
