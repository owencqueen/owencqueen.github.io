short_text: We present a review of previous work in graph machine learning to learn relational structures, provide greater interpretability, and integrate multiple modalities for biomedical data. We additionally identify future areas of focus for the field, in particular how foundation models on graphs can lead to clinically meaningful predictions and facilitate feedback loops with practitioners.
