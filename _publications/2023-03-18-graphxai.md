short_text: We benchmark several post-hoc GNN explainers on established real-world and synthetic datasets. We introduce several new metrics and experimental setups to evaluate explainers in a diverse manner. In addition, we introduce a new synthetic graph dataset generator that supports robust evaluation of explainers for GNNs.
