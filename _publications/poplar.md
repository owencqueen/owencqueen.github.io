short_text: Using deep learning approaches, we learn to geolocate poplar trees from pre-alignment read fragments. We use a popular bioinformatics tool for finding common read fragment motifs, which is much faster than aligning all fragments to a reference genome. Through our simple approach, we show competitive results to algorithms trained on WGS data.
