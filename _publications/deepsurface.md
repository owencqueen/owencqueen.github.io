short_text: We fine-tune pretrained protein language models on oceanic microbial genomics data to disciminate organisms found at the surface and subsurface of the ocean. We then use post-hoc explainability techniques to identify important residues that discriminate homologous proteins found at the surface and subsurface. We visualize the importance scores on the Alphafold-generated structure, and we work with microbiologists to identify biologically-relevant differences in these proteins.
