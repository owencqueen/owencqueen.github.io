short_text: We present a new time-series explainability method, TimeX. TimeX learns an interpretable surrogate model for a given predictor that learns to match predictor behavior through a novel loss known as model behavior consistency. TimeX introduces straight-through estimators (STEs) to learn discrete, faithful masks that match model behavior, learning succinct, interpretable masks that explain predictions on time series datasets. We benchmark TimeX on a wide variety of synthetic and real-world time-series datasets and demonstrate that it learns explanations that are highly faithful to model predictions.
