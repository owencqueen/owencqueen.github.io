short_text: ProCyon is an 11B parameter multimodal model designed to predict and generate protein phenotypes across multiple scales of biology, spanning molecular functions to disease and therapeutics. We demonstrate its applicability in a variety of tasks, including novel transfer to poorly-characterized proteins, synthetic peptide binding, and indiciation-specific drug target retrieval.
